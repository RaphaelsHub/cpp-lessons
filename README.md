# ðŸ“˜ C/C++ Programming Course â€“ Structured Learning Materials

This repository contains thematically structured learning materials for the **C/C++ programming languages**. It is designed for students, beginner developers, and anyone looking to learn both the fundamentals and more advanced concepts of these languages.

The folders are organized by difficulty level and topic â€” starting from basic concepts such as **variables**, **conditional statements**, and **loops**, and progressing to more complex topics like **data structures**, **pointers**, **sorting algorithms**, **file handling**, and elements of **object-oriented programming** (based on C++).

Each section includes practical code examples and can be used in **university courses**, **classroom teaching**, or for **self-study**. This step-by-step approach helps reinforce understanding through practice and real-world exercises.

Feel free to explore, run the code, and build on top of it as you grow your skills in C and C++!
